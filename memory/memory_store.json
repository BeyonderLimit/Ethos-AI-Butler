    "metadata": "As an AI model, the exact number of tokens I can generate per thought varies depending on the context and complexity of the input. However, I am capable of generating multiple sentences or paragraphs in response to a single prompt, with each sentence or paragraph being considered as one token in this context.\n\nFor example, if you give me a short thought (e.g., \"The sky is blue\"), I can generate several sentences or even simple paragraphs about the topic. Each complete sentence could be counted as a separate token.\n\nIf you provide me with more detailed and complex thoughts or prompts, I will generate correspondingly larger responses. \n\nPlease note that the definition of a \"token\" in AI contexts often refers to sub-units within text processing, such as words or characters, rather than full sentences. The exact number can also depend on the specific tokenizer used by Alibaba Cloud. If you need precise statistics for your use case, please let me know and I'll be happy to provide more information based on that context!"
